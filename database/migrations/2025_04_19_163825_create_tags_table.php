/*

A pivot table is a table used to connect two other tables in a many-to-many relationship.

In your case, the pivot table is job_tag, and it connects:

Jobs (job_listings)

Tags (tags)

Example : 

Relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) donâ€™t support many-to-many directly. So you create a third table (pivot table) to link the two.

For example:

Jobs Table

id	title
1	Developer
2	Designer
Tags Table

id	name
1	remote
2	full-time
job_tag (Pivot Table)

job_id	tag_id
1	    1
1	    2
2	    1

This say that a developer is both remote and full time, which is a many-to-many relationship.

Example : 

insert into job_tag(job_listing_id,tag_id) values (10,1);--means job with an id of 10 is associated with tag of 1
