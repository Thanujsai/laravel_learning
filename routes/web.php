    When you use:

    ðŸ‘‰ Yes â€” it expects the JobController to have these specific method names:

    HTTP Verb    URI              Controller Method    Purpose
    GET          /jobs            index()              Display a list of jobs
    GET          /jobs/create     create()             Show a form to create a new job
    POST         /jobs            store()              Save the new job
    GET          /jobs/{job}      show()               Display a single job
    GET          /jobs/{job}/edit edit()               Show a form to edit a job
    PATCH/PUT    /jobs/{job}      update()             Update the job
    DELETE       /jobs/{job}      destroy()            Delete the job

/*
    If you don't want to generate a particular route, you can use the except method to exclude it:
    Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class)->except(['create', 'edit']);
    This will generate all the routes except the create and edit routes.

    If you want to generate only a few routes, you can use the only method to include only those routes:
    Route::resource('jobs', JobController::class)->only(['index', 'show']);
    This will generate only the index and show routes.
