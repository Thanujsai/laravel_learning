Very identical queries are running multiple times.

The N+1 problem happens when your app makes 1 query to get a list of items (like jobs), but for each item, it makes another query to get related data (like employer). That means:

1 query for all jobs

+1 query per job to fetch its employer

So if you have 10 jobs → that’s 11 queries


Another solution is to prevent lazy loading by adding this line
        Model::preventLazyLoading();

in boot method of AppServiceProvider.
