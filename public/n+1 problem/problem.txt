Very identical queries are running multiple times.

The N+1 problem happens when your app makes 1 query to get a list of items (like jobs), but for each item, it makes another query to get related data (like employer). That means:

1 query for all jobs

+1 query per job to fetch its employer

So if you have 10 jobs → that’s 11 queries


Another solution is to prevent lazy loading by adding this line
        Model::preventLazyLoading();

in boot method of AppServiceProvider.

🐢 N+1 Problem — Lazy Loading (Bad)
You have two models:

Post model

Comment model

🧠 Relationships
In Post.php:

public function comments()
{
    return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
}

🐌 Controller (Lazy Loading)
$posts = Post::all(); // 1 query to fetch all posts

foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo $post->title;
    foreach ($post->comments as $comment) {
        echo $comment->body; // This triggers 1 query PER post
    }
}
If there are 10 posts, this makes:

1 query for all posts

10 additional queries (1 per post to get its comments)

Total = 11 queries (N+1 problem)

⚡ Solution — Eager Loading (Good)
Instead of loading related models later (lazily), you load them up front (eagerly).

✅ Controller (Eager Loading)
$posts = Post::with('comments')->get(); // 2 queries total

foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo $post->title;
    foreach ($post->comments as $comment) {
        echo $comment->body; // No extra queries triggered here
    }
}
✅ Queries behind the scenes:
One for all posts

One for all related comments
→ Total = 2 queries, no matter how many posts you have. 🎯
