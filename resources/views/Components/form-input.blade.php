    {{-- In Laravel Blade components, every component automatically gets a special $attributes object.
    This $attributes contains any HTML attributes passed into the component but not explicitly handled in the PHP side.

    $attributes->merge([...]) means:

    Take whatever attributes the user passed in (like required, maxlength, class, etc.)

    Merge them with some default attributes you want.

    This way, you can predefine some defaults but still allow people to override or add more!

    ✨ Your example:
    blade
    Copy
    Edit
    <input {{ $attributes->merge(['class' => "block min-w-0 grow py-1.5 pr-3 pl-1 text-base text-gray-900 placeholder:text-gray-400 focus:outline-none sm:text-sm/6"]) }}>
    ✅ It means:

    The input will always have your default class attributes like block min-w-0 grow py-1.5 ...

    If the caller passes additional attributes (like required, placeholder, or extra class names), they get merged in.

    If the caller also passes a class attribute, Laravel will combine the classes, not overwrite them. --}}
